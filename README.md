# Flask OTP Verification Web Application  

## Overview  
This Flask-based application enables users to register, receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via email, and verify their identity through OTP input. It features secure user authentication, email-based registration validation, and a protected dashboard accessible only to verified users. The OTP is time-sensitive, adding an extra layer of security.  

## Key Features  
### 1. OTP-Enabled User Registration  
Users sign up with a username, email, and password. An OTP is sent to their registered email for verification.  

### 2. Time-Limited OTP  
The OTP expires after 2 minutes. Users must re-register or request a new OTP if it expires.  

### 3. User Login  
Once verified, users can log in with their email and password.
